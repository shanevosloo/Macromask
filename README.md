# Macromask
MacroMask is an app just for automating tasks on the frontend, some systems get too large to maintain or develop leaving users stuck in limbo, doing hours of repetitive work or waiting months for the dev team to help with tools or SQL updates. Taking control of mouse and keyboard doing the meanial task and allowing the user to keep an eye out for whats going on

This is a project that follows on learning development, I've had many iterations and try this out on different languages like AutoIT(BASIC-like scripting language), Java and now C# (Unity Game engine and Winforms)
Work is still in progress...

##Use
The intent is to do a check for condition and then action a specific task, with the option to Pause or stop running the actions or a specific check thats stuck using F7
Then allow repeating the process, allowing the user to break from the reapeat with F6
